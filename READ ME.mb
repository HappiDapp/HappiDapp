Video Compression Script

This script allows you to apply heavy compression to a video file, simulating the effect of a video that has undergone multiple rounds of sharing, resulting in very low quality.

Usage:
1. Place the video file you want to compress in the same folder as this script.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter (Python 3.x recommended).
3. Follow the prompts to input the desired compression settings.
4. The script will create a compressed video file with the specified settings.

Compression Settings:
- Video Bitrate: Enter a value for video bitrate (e.g., 8k, 4M). Lower values result in worse quality.
- Frame Rate: Enter a value for frame rate (e.g., 5, 10). Lower values create choppier motion.
- Audio Bitrate: Enter a value for audio bitrate (e.g., 2k, 128k). Lower values result in worse audio quality.
- Audio Volume Boost: Enter a value for audio volume boost (dB, e.g., 10). Higher values make audio louder.

Note:
- The script uses FFmpeg for video and audio processing. Make sure FFmpeg is installed and accessible from the command line, if you don't you can use 'pip install ffmpeg' in a command prompt.
- The compressed video file will have the format "compressed_[INPUT_FILENAME].ext". If the filename already exists, a numbering scheme will be applied (e.g., "compressed_[INPUT_FILENAME](1).ext").

Disclaimer:
- This script is intended for fun and experimentation. Extreme compression can lead to distorted and unrecognizable output.
